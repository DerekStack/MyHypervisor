# MyHypervisor

# Introduction
MyHypervisor is is an Open Source light-weighted Hypervisor. This project explores the use of hypervisor technology combined with memory encryption and decryption techniques as a defense against these attacks. By securing memory regions and controlling access at the hypervisor level, we aim to protect critical data from both external devices and potential internal threats.

# Objectives
The primary objectives of this project are:
- To implement memory encryption that secures sensitive data against unauthorized DMA access.
- To implement monitoring and logging mechanisms for tracking potential DMA attack attempts.
- To contribute to the open-source community by providing a scalable and adaptable framework.

# Key Features
- Memory Encryption: Protect sensitive data in memory through strong encryption algorithms.
- Hypervisor Isolation: Utilize hypervisor technology to isolate encrypted memory from unauthorized access.
- Controlled Decryption: Safeguard the process of decrypting information, ensuring that only authorized requests are served.
- Monitoring: Real-time monitoring of DMA activity to detect suspicious behavior.
